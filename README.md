Adding SQLite to Lab 2

## Steps I took to connect to SQLite
1. Installing SQLite through 'npm install sqlite3' command.
2. Connect to the database, connection made in connect.js file.
3. After importing sqlite3, I created a database 'db'.
4. Added an error clause and added console log message to see if connection has been made and connection has been closed.
5. Created database file, added conatct list
6. Tried to run sqlite
7. Entered the following in the command line:
    - sqlite3 db.sqlite
    - .read database/init/db.sql
    - .quit --> to exit, but didn't actually work
